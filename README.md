# rectangle_to_square_matrix_market

The code reads a rectangle matrix in Matrix Market (.mtx) format and converts it into square format matrix followed by CSR representation of the graph.  
We can now apply the operations involved in the square matrices in the CSR data structure.

The code uses Eigen library. It is generally avaialable as a modules in Supercomputers. For Local servers installation of the library may be needed.

Note: The code is a First version. May have issues. Suggestions or issue reports are appreciated.
